# Sublime Gherkin

A simple Gherkin (Cucumber) language support for Sublime Text editor.

## Features

* [Gherkin] syntax highlighting (taken from [cucumber-sublime-bundle]),
* Common snippets for English and Polish language.

## Why?

There already is a [cucumber-sublime-bundle] package but it also includes additional features: [Table Cleaner][table-cleaner] which is a separate package you can install, steps autocompletions, which work only for English language, and syntax highlighting for Ruby steps definitions.

If you look for only syntax highlighting in .features files, this repository is for you.

## Installation

1. Go to your `packages` folder (Preferences -> Browser packages...)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/mrliptontea/sublime-gherkin.git Gherkin`
